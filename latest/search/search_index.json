That is, each row of the table is represented as one of Julia's new \nNamedTuple\ns, which are easy to use and highly efficient.\n\n\nThus, manipulating data as a \nTable\n is as easy as manipulating arrays and named tuples - which is something Julia was specifically designed to make simple, efficient and \nfun\n.\n\n\nTable\ns (and their columns) may be an \nAbstractArray\n of any dimensionality. This let's you take advantage of Julia's powerful array functionality, such as multidimensional broadcasting. Each column must be an array of the same dimensionality and size of the other columns.\n\n\n\n\nWhy use a \nTable\n?\n\n\nTwo words: productivity and speed.\n\n\nTypedTables.jl\n aims to introduce very few concepts, with minimal learning curve to let you manipulate tabular data. The \nTable\n type is a simple wrapper over columns and presents the well-known and extremely productive \nAbstractArray\n interface. If you are familiar with arrays and named tuples, you should be able to write your data analytics with a \nTable\n.\n\n\nHowever, it would be of little use if the data container was inherently slow, or if using the container was subject to traps and pitfalls where performance falls of a cliff if the programmer uses an otherwise-idiomatic pattern. In this case, \nfor\n loops over the rows of a \nTable\n are possible at the speed of hand-written code in a statically compiled language such as C, because the compiler is fully aware of the types of each column. Thus, users can write generic functions using a mixture of hand-written loops, calls to functions such as \nmap\n, \nfilter\n, \nreduce\n, \ngroup\n and \ninnerjoin\n, as well as high-level interfaces provided by packages such as \nQuery.jl\n - and still obtain optimal performance.\n\n\nFinally, since \nTable\n is unoppinionated about the underlying array storage (and acts more as a convenient metaprogramming layer), the arrays represent each column might have rather distinct properties:\n\n\n\n\nMissing values can be modelled by \nmissing\n and by having columns of element type \nUnion{T, Missing}\n.\n\n\nTypical \nArray\n-based columns represent continugous chunks of memory, and can be \nmemory-mapped\n from disk for a simple way of doing out-of-core analytics.\n\n\nAcceleration indices can be attached to columns using the \nAcceleratedArrays\n package, speeding up searches and joins.\n\n\nSome data can be stored in compressed form using \nsparse arrays\n, \ncategorical arrays\n, and so-on.\n\n\nColumns could be stored and processed on a GPU with \nGPU-backed array\n using \nCUDA\n, \nOpenCL\n, \nArrayFire\n, etc.\n\n\nColumns might be distributed and processed in parallel over multiple machines with \nDistributedArrays\n or between multiple processes with \nSharedArrays\n.\n\n\nIn extreme cases, tables with a small, fixed number of rows might be most efficient represented with a \nstatically sized array\n.\n\n\n\n\nIn each case, the user will be able to use much the same interface (and code) to perform their transformations. In the background, Julia's compiler will create specialized, performant machine code, for whichever backing array you choose.\n\n\n\n\nCreating \nTable\ns\n\n\nThe easiest way to create a table from columns is with keyword arguments, such as\n\n\njulia\n t = Table(name = [\nAlice\n, \nBob\n, \nCharlie\n], age = [25, 42, 37])\nTable with 2 columns and 3 rows:\n     name     age\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Alice    25\n 2 \u2502 Bob      42\n 3 \u2502 Charlie  37\n\n\n\n\nThe constructor will equally accept a \nNamedTuple\n of columns, as \nTable((name = [\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\"], age = [25, 42, 37]))\n (note the extra brackets).\n\n\nAlso, one can easily convert the row-storage-based vector of named tuples into columnar storage using the \nTable\n constructor:\n\n\njulia\n Table([(name = \nAlice\n, age = 25), (name = \nBob\n, age = 42), (name = \nCharlie\n, age = 37)])\nTable with 2 columns and 3 rows:\n     name     age\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Alice    25\n 2 \u2502 Bob      42\n 3 \u2502 Charlie  37\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing data stored in \nTable\ns\n\n\n\n\nRow access\n\n\nA single row of a \nTable\n is just a \nNamedTuple\n, which is easy to access.\n\n\njulia\n t[1]\n(name = \nAlice\n, age = 25)\n\n\n\n\nMultiple rows can be indexed similarly to standard arrays in Julia:\n\n\njulia\n t[2:3]\nTable with 2 columns and 2 rows:\n     name     age\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Bob      42\n 2 \u2502 Charlie  37\n\n\n\n\nOne can interrogate the \nlength\n, \nsize\n or \naxes\n of a \nTable\n just like any other \nAbstractArray\n:\n\n\njulia\n length(t)\n3\n\njulia\n size(t)\n(3,)\n\n\n\n\n(Note: the number of columns does not participate in the \nsize\n.)\n\n\nFinally, if the backing arrays support mutation, rows can be mutated with \nsetindex!\n\n\njulia\n t[3] = (name = Charlie, name = 38)  # Charlie had a birthday\nTable with 2 columns and 3 rows:\n     name     age\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Alice    25\n 2 \u2502 Bob      42\n 3 \u2502 Charlie  38\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, rows can be added or removed with \npush!\n, \npop!\n and \nso-on\n.\n\n\n\n\nColumn access\n\n\nA single column can be recovered using Julia's new \ngetproperty\n syntax using the \n.\n operator.\n\n\njulia\n t.name\n3-element Array{String,1}:\n \nAlice\n  \n \nBob\n    \n \nCharlie\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, the simplest way to extract more than one column is to construct a brand new table out of the columns (as in \ntable2 = Table(column1 = table1.column1, column2 = table1.column2, ...)\n).\n\n\nThe columns of a \nTable\n can be accessed directly as a \nNamedTuple\n of arrays using the \ncolumns\n function.\n\n\njulia\n columns(t)\n(name = [\nAlice\n, \nBob\n, \nCharlie\n], age = [25, 42, 37])\n\n\n\n\nThere is a \ncolumnnames\n function for getting the names of the columns:\n\n\njulia\n columnnames(t)\n(:name, :age)\n\n\n\n\nNote that the column names are Julia \nSymbol\ns, which are \ninterned strings\n tracked by the compiler.\n\n\nFinally, the values contained in entire columns may be updated using \n.=\n, such as \nt.age .= 0\n or \nt.age .= [26, 43, 38]\n. Note that skipping the \n.\n in \n.=\n, such as \nt.age = [26, 43, 38]\n, will produce an error because the references to the column \ncontainers\n are immutable (if you wish to replace the entire \ncontainer\n of a column, you may need to use a \nFlexTable\n).\n\n\n\n\nCell access\n\n\nFrom the above, we can see two identical ways to get a cell of data:\n\n\njulia\n t[1].name\n\nAlice\n\n\njulia\n t.name[1]\n\nAlice\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile Julia's compiler will elide a lot of unnecessary code, you may find it faster to index individual cells of the table using the second option (to avoid fetching and constructing the \nentire\n named tuple of a row as an intermediate step).\n\n\nSimilarly, the value of a cell can be updated via \nsetindex!\n, for example using the syntax \nt.name[1] = \"Alicia\"\n. Note that the syntax \nt[1].name = \"Alicia\"\n will error because you are trying to mutate \nt[1]\n, which is an immutable \ncopy\n of the data (completely independent from \nt\n).\n\n\n\n\nComparison with a \nDataFrame\n\n\nFor those with experience using the \nDataFrames.jl\n package, this comparison may be useful:\n\n\n\n\nThe columns stored in a \nTable\n are immutable - you cannot add, remove or rename a column. However, it is very cheap to create a new table with different columns, encouraging a functional programming style to deal with your outer data structure. (See also \nFlexTable\n for a more flexible alternative). For compison, this is a similar approach to \nIndexedTables\n and \nJuliaDB\n, while \nDataFrames\n uses an untyped vector of columns.\n\n\nThe columns themselves may be mutable. You may modify the data in one-or-more columns, and add or remove rows as necessary. Thus, operations on the \ndata\n (not the data \nstructure\n) can follow an imperative form, if desired.\n\n\nThe types of the columns are known to the compiler, making direct operations like iteration of the rows of a \nTable\n very fast. The programmer is free to write a combination of low-level \nfor\n loops, use operations like \nmap\n, \nfilter\n, \nreduce\n, \ngroup\n or \ninnerjoin\n, or to use a high-level query interface such as \nQuery.jl\n - all with the high performance you would expect of a statically compiled language.\n\n\nConversely, the Julia compiler spends effort tracking the names and types of all the columns of the table. If you have a very large number of columns (many hundreds), \nTable\n may not be a suitable data structure (here, \nDataFrame\ns dynamically sized and typed vector of columns may be more appropriate).\n\n\nTable\ns can be an array of any dimensionality.\n\n\nUnlike a \nDataFrame\n, you cannot access a single cell in a single \ngetindex\n call (you should first extract a column, and index a cell from that column). Similarly, the number of columns does not participate in the \nsize\n or \nlength\n of a \nTable\n.\n\n\n\n\nA good litimus test of whether a statically-compiled \nTable\n or a dynamic approach like \nDataFrames\n is more appropriate, is to see whether the written \ncode\n tends to refer to the columns by name, or whether the column names are more dynamic (and, for example, iteration over columns is required).",

            "text": "For those with experience using the  DataFrames.jl  package, this comparison may be useful:   The columns stored in a  Table  are immutable - you cannot add, remove or rename a column. However, it is very cheap to create a new table with different columns, encouraging a functional programming style to deal with your outer data structure. (See also  FlexTable  for a more flexible alternative). For compison, this is a similar approach to  IndexedTables  and  JuliaDB , while  DataFrames  uses an untyped vector of columns.  The columns themselves may be mutable. You may modify the data in one-or-more columns, and add or remove rows as necessary. Thus, operations on the  data  (not the data  structure ) can follow an imperative form, if desired.  The types of the columns are known to the compiler, making direct operations like iteration of the rows of a  Table  very fast. The programmer is free to write a combination of low-level  for  loops, use operations like  map ,  filter ,  reduce ,  group  or  innerjoin , or to use a high-level query interface such as  Query.jl  - all with the high performance you would expect of a statically compiled language.  Conversely, the Julia compiler spends effort tracking the names and types of all the columns of the table. If you have a very large number of columns (many hundreds),  Table  may not be a suitable data structure (here,  DataFrame s dynamically sized and typed vector of columns may be more appropriate).  Table s can be an array of any dimensionality.  Unlike a  DataFrame , you cannot access a single cell in a single  getindex  call (you should first extract a column, and index a cell from that column). Similarly, the number of columns does not participate in the  size  or  length  of a  Table .   A good litimus test of whether a statically-compiled  Table  or a dynamic approach like  DataFrames  is more appropriate, is to see whether the written  code  tends to refer to the columns by name, or whether the column names are more dynamic (and, for example, iteration over columns is required).",

To demonstrate the power of grouping, this time we'll add some more rows and columns to our example data.  julia  t = Table(firstname = [ Alice ,  Bob ,  Charlie ,  Adam ,  Eve ,  Cindy ,  Arthur ], lastname = [ Smith ,  Smith ,  Smith ,  Williams ,  Williams ,  Brown ,  King ], age = [25, 42, 37, 65, 18, 33, 54])\nTable with 3 columns and 7 rows:\n     firstname  lastname  age\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Alice      Smith     25\n 2 \u2502 Bob        Smith     42\n 3 \u2502 Charlie    Smith     37\n 4 \u2502 Adam       Williams  65\n 5 \u2502 Eve        Williams  18\n 6 \u2502 Cindy      Brown     33\n 7 \u2502 Arthur     King      54  Let's get familiar with the  basic  usage of  group  on standard (non-tabular) arrays. For example, let's group people's first name by their first letter.  julia  group(first, t.firstname)\nDict{Char,Array{String,1}} with 4 entries:\n  'C' =  [ Charlie ,  Cindy ]\n  'A' =  [ Alice ,  Adam ,  Arthur ]\n  'E' =  [ Eve ]\n  'B' =  [ Bob ]  The groups are returned as a  Dict  where they indices (or keys) of the dictionary are the first character of people's firstname string. The values of the  Dict  are arrays listing the matching firstnames.  Next, we may want to group up data coming from a table (not just a single column). For example, we may want to group firstnames by lastname.  julia  group(getproperty(:lastname), getproperty(:firstname), t)\nDict{String,Array{String,1}} with 4 entries:\n   King      =  [ Arthur ]\n   Williams  =  [ Adam ,  Eve ]\n   Brown     =  [ Cindy ]\n   Smith     =  [ Alice ,  Bob ,  Charlie ]  Note that the returned structure is still not a  Table  at all - it is a dictionary ( Dict ) with the unique  lastname  values as keys, returing (non-tabular) arrays of  firstname .  If instead, our grouping elements are  rows , the group will be a table. For example, we can just drop the  getproperty(:firstname)  projection to get:  julia  groups = group(getproperty(:lastname), t)\nGroups{String,Any,Table{NamedTuple{(:firstname, :lastname, :age),Tuple{String,String,Int64}},1,NamedTuple{(:firstname, :lastname, :age),Tuple{Array{String,1},Array{String,1},Array{Int64,1}}}},Dict{String,Array{Int64,1}}} with 4 entries:\n   King      =  Table with 3 columns and 1 row:\u2026\n   Williams  =  Table with 3 columns and 2 rows:\u2026\n   Brown     =  Table with 3 columns and 1 row:\u2026\n   Smith     =  Table with 3 columns and 3 rows:\u2026  The results are only summarized (for compactness), but can be easily accessed.  julia  groups[ Smith ]\nTable with 3 columns and 3 rows:\n     firstname  lastname  age\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Alice      Smith     25\n 2 \u2502 Bob        Smith     42\n 3 \u2502 Charlie    Smith     37",

            "text": "Joining data\n\n\nThe methods defined so far work on single data sources (tables) at-a-time. Sometimes, we need to \njoin\n information together from multiple tables.\n\n\n\n\nCartesian product/join of tables\n\n\nBefore progressing to the typical \"join\" operations on tables, we'll discuss the Cartesian product (or Cartesian \"join\") between two tables. In SQL, this is called the \nCROSS JOIN\n.\n\n\nSuppose \ntable1\n has \nn\n rows, and \ntable2\n has \nm\n rows. We can create a new table that contains \nn \u00d7 m\n rows with the data from \ntable1\n and \ntable2\n. In fact, if the output \ntable3\n were an \nn \u00d7 m\n \nmatrix\n of rows, we could say that the row \ntable3[i, j]\n contains the combination of \ntable1[i]\n and \ntable2[j]\n.\n\n\nThe easiest way to do this is with the \nSplitApplyCombine.product\n. For a quick primer, \nout = product(f, a, b)\n returns an array \nout\n such that \nout[i, j] = f(a, b)\n. For example, let's take all combinations of the sums of \n[1, 2, 3]\n and \n[10, 20, 30, 40]\n.\n\n\njulia\n product(+, [1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30, 40])\n3\u00d74 Array{Int64,2}:\n 11  21  31  41\n 12  22  32  42\n 13  23  33  43\n\n\n\n\nOne can also use \ntuple\n to simply collect both sets of data.\n\n\njulia\n product(tuple, [1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30, 40])\n3\u00d74 Array{Tuple{Int64,Int64},2}:\n (1, 10)  (1, 20)  (1, 30)  (1, 40)\n (2, 10)  (2, 20)  (2, 30)  (2, 40)\n (3, 10)  (3, 20)  (3, 30)  (3, 40)\n\n\n\n\n(Note that \ntuple\n is the \nonly\n option for the similar function \nIterators.product\n). Let's try this with a table. This time, for two tables with \ndistinct\n column names, we can use the \nmerge\n function to merge the rows into single \nNamedTuple\ns - for example, take this list of all pairings of firstnames and lastnames.\n\n\njulia\n t1 = Table(firstname = [\nAlice\n, \nBob\n, \nCharlie\n])\nTable with 1 column and 3 rows:\n     firstname\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Alice\n 2 \u2502 Bob\n 3 \u2502 Charlie\n\njulia\n t2 = Table(lastname = [\nSmith\n, \nWilliams\n, \nBrown\n, \nKing\n])\nTable with 1 column and 4 rows:\n     lastname\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Smith\n 2 \u2502 Williams\n 3 \u2502 Brown\n 4 \u2502 King\n\njulia\n t3 = product(merge, t1, t2)\nTable with 2 columns and 3\u00d74 rows:\n       firstname  lastname\n     \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1,1 \u2502 Alice      Smith\n 2,1 \u2502 Bob        Smith\n 3,1 \u2502 Charlie    Smith\n 1,2 \u2502 Alice      Williams\n 2,2 \u2502 Bob        Williams\n 3,2 \u2502 Charlie    Williams\n 1,3 \u2502 Alice      Brown\n 2,3 \u2502 Bob        Brown\n 3,3 \u2502 Charlie    Brown\n 1,4 \u2502 Alice      King\n 2,4 \u2502 Bob        King\n 3,4 \u2502 Charlie    King\n\njulia\n size(t3)\n(3, 4)\n\n\n\n\nRemember that one must be careful that the column names are indeed distinct when using \nproduct(merge, ...)\n this way.\n\n\nThis is our first example of a \nTable\n which an array of higher than one-dimension - it is an \nAbstractMatrix\n. The \nproduct\n of many tables may be a \n3\n- or higher-dimensional array. Note that higher-dimensional tables do not print as a matrix like other higher-dimensional arrays at the REPL, as this would quickly obscure the columns. Instead, the indices are displayed to the left of each row.\n\n\nFinally, also note that there is a \nproductview\n function for performing this operation lazily. This may be crucial to remember - the size of the output is the \nproduct\n of the size of the inputs, which grows very quickly even for very reasonably sized input tables. This operation can be very expensive in both time and memory if appropriate care isn't taken.\n\n\n\n\nRelational \"join\"\n\n\nIn a nutshell: the relational \"join\" operation is simply the above Cartesian product followed by a filtering operation. Generally, the filtering operation will depend on information coming from \nboth\n input data sets - for example, that the values in a particular column must match exactly. (Any filtering that depends only on information from one input table can be done more efficiently \nbefore\n the join operation).\n\n\nFor a simple example, let's look for all pairings of firstnames and lastnames that have an equal number of characters. For efficiency, we combine this with \nproductview\n.\n\n\njulia\n filter(row -\n length(row.firstname) == length(row.lastname), t3)\nTable with 2 columns and 2 rows:\n     firstname  lastname\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Alice      Smith\n 2 \u2502 Alice      Brown\n\n\n\n\nMany might find that this two-step process a rather indirect way of performing a join operation. Below we cover two more standard techniques.\n\n\n\n\nUsing primary and foreign keys\n\n\nBefore launching into \ninnerjoin\n, it is worth taking a detour to expore a common case where a far simpler operation can perform the requisite join - indexing!\n\n\nIn a relation, a \"primary\" key is a column (or multiple columns) with values that uniquely identify the row - no two rows may have the same primary key. \nTable\n and \nFlexTable\n do not \ndirectly\n support uniqueness in the columns (though the \narray\n corresponding to a column could surely enforce uniqueness). However, each row \nis\n uniquely identified by it's index, for example \nt1[1]\n corresponds to the row \n(firstname = \"Alice\",)\n.\n\n\nIn fact, using the array index as the primary key can be the most efficient way of uniquely identifying your data. A second table with related data may indeed have a column containing the indices of relevant rows in the first table. Such columns are generally referred to as being a \"foreign key\" (they uniquely identify data in a \"foreign\" table).\n\n\nAs an example, let's take a simplistic \ncustomers\n and \norders\n database.\n\n\njulia\n customers = Table(name = [\nAlice\n, \nBob\n, \nCharlie\n], address = [\n12 Beach Street\n, \n163 Moon Road\n, \n6 George Street\n])\nTable with 2 columns and 3 rows:\n     name     address\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Alice    12 Beach Street\n 2 \u2502 Bob      163 Moon Road\n 3 \u2502 Charlie  6 George Street\n\njulia\n orders = Table(customer_id = [2, 2, 3, 3], items = [\nSocks\n, \nTie\n, \nShirt\n, \nUnderwear\n])\nTable with 2 columns and 4 rows:\n     customer_id  items\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 2            Socks\n 2 \u2502 2            Tie\n 3 \u2502 3            Shirt\n 4 \u2502 3            Underwear\n\n\n\n\nTo get the customer for each order is just a simple indexing operation.\n\n\njulia\n customers[orders.customer_id]\nTable with 2 columns and 4 rows:\n     name     address\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Bob      163 Moon Road\n 2 \u2502 Bob      163 Moon Road\n 3 \u2502 Charlie  6 George Street\n 4 \u2502 Charlie  6 George Street\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can denormalize the orders and their customers to a single table by performing a \nmerge\n on each row (in this case using broadcasting dot-syntax for brevity).\n\n\njulia\n merge.(customers[orders.customer_id], orders)\nTable with 4 columns and 4 rows:\n     name     address          customer_id  items\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Bob      163 Moon Road    2            Socks\n 2 \u2502 Bob      163 Moon Road    2            Tie\n 3 \u2502 Charlie  6 George Street  3            Shirt\n 4 \u2502 Charlie  6 George Street  3            Underwear\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can perform these operation lazily for cost \nO\n(1) using \nview\n and \nmapview\n - after which the data can be processed further.\n\n\njulia\n mapview(merge, view(customers, orders.customer_id), orders)\nTable with 4 columns and 4 rows:\n     name     address          customer_id  items\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Bob      163 Moon Road    2            Socks\n 2 \u2502 Bob      163 Moon Road    2            Tie\n 3 \u2502 Charlie  6 George Street  3            Shirt\n 4 \u2502 Charlie  6 George Street  3            Underwear\n\n\n\n\nThis is a simple and powerful technique.

            "text": "Before progressing to the typical \"join\" operations on tables, we'll discuss the Cartesian product (or Cartesian \"join\") between two tables. In SQL, this is called the  CROSS JOIN .  Suppose  table1  has  n  rows, and  table2  has  m  rows. We can create a new table that contains  n \u00d7 m  rows with the data from  table1  and  table2 . In fact, if the output  table3  were an  n \u00d7 m   matrix  of rows, we could say that the row  table3[i, j]  contains the combination of  table1[i]  and  table2[j] .  The easiest way to do this is with the  SplitApplyCombine.product . For a quick primer,  out = product(f, a, b)  returns an array  out  such that  out[i, j] = f(a, b) . For example, let's take all combinations of the sums of  [1, 2, 3]  and  [10, 20, 30, 40] .  julia  product(+, [1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30, 40])\n3\u00d74 Array{Int64,2}:\n 11  21  31  41\n 12  22  32  42\n 13  23  33  43  One can also use  tuple  to simply collect both sets of data.  julia  product(tuple, [1, 2, 3], [10, 20, 30, 40])\n3\u00d74 Array{Tuple{Int64,Int64},2}:\n (1, 10)  (1, 20)  (1, 30)  (1, 40)\n (2, 10)  (2, 20)  (2, 30)  (2, 40)\n (3, 10)  (3, 20)  (3, 30)  (3, 40)  (Note that  tuple  is the  only  option for the similar function  Iterators.product ). Let's try this with a table. This time, for two tables with  distinct  column names, we can use the  merge  function to merge the rows into single  NamedTuple s - for example, take this list of all pairings of firstnames and lastnames.  julia  t1 = Table(firstname = [ Alice ,  Bob ,  Charlie ])\nTable with 1 column and 3 rows:\n     firstname\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Alice\n 2 \u2502 Bob\n 3 \u2502 Charlie\n\njulia  t2 = Table(lastname = [ Smith ,  Williams ,  Brown ,  King ])\nTable with 1 column and 4 rows:\n     lastname\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 Smith\n 2 \u2502 Williams\n 3 \u2502 Brown\n 4 \u2502 King\n\njulia  t3 = product(merge, t1, t2)\nTable with 2 columns and 3\u00d74 rows:\n       firstname  lastname\n     \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1,1 \u2502 Alice      Smith\n 2,1 \u2502 Bob        Smith\n 3,1 \u2502 Charlie    Smith\n 1,2 \u2502 Alice      Williams\n 2,2 \u2502 Bob        Williams\n 3,2 \u2502 Charlie    Williams\n 1,3 \u2502 Alice      Brown\n 2,3 \u2502 Bob        Brown\n 3,3 \u2502 Charlie    Brown\n 1,4 \u2502 Alice      King\n 2,4 \u2502 Bob        King\n 3,4 \u2502 Charlie    King\n\njulia  size(t3)\n(3, 4)  Remember that one must be careful that the column names are indeed distinct when using  product(merge, ...)  this way.

Note that higher-dimensional tables do not print as a matrix like other higher-dimensional arrays at the REPL, as this would quickly obscure the columns. Instead, the indices are displayed to the left of each row.  Finally, also note that there is a  productview  function for performing this operation lazily. This may be crucial to remember - the size of the output is the  product  of the size of the inputs, which grows very quickly even for very reasonably sized input tables.

            "text": "Before launching into  innerjoin , it is worth taking a detour to expore a common case where a far simpler operation can perform the requisite join - indexing!  In a relation, a \"primary\" key is a column (or multiple columns) with values that uniquely identify the row - no two rows may have the same primary key.  Table  and  FlexTable  do not  directly  support uniqueness in the columns (though the  array  corresponding to a column could surely enforce uniqueness). However, each row  is  uniquely identified by it's index, for example  t1[1]  corresponds to the row  (firstname = \"Alice\",) .  In fact, using the array index as the primary key can be the most efficient way of uniquely identifying your data. A second table with related data may indeed have a column containing the indices of relevant rows in the first table. Such columns are generally referred to as being a \"foreign key\" (they uniquely identify data in a \"foreign\" table).

In the simplest case, such as a natural join, for  f  we may want to  merge  all the columns from both input tables, and the  comparison  operator may be equality (it defaults to  isequal ).  As an example, we modify our  customers  table to explicitly include the customer's  id , similarly to above.  julia  customers = Table(id = [1, 2, 3], name = [ Alice ,  Bob ,  Charlie ], address = [ 12 Beach Street ,  163 Moon Road ,  6 George Street ])\nTable with 3 columns and 3 rows:\n     id  name     address\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 1   Alice    12 Beach Street\n 2 \u2502 2   Bob      163 Moon Road\n 3 \u2502 3   Charlie  6 George Street\n\njulia  innerjoin(getproperty(:id), getproperty(:customer_id), customers, orders)\nTable with 5 columns and 4 rows:\n     id  name     address          customer_id  items\n   \u250c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n 1 \u2502 2   Bob      163 Moon Road    2            Socks\n 2 \u2502 2   Bob      163 Moon Road    2            Tie\n 3 \u2502 3   Charlie  6 George Street  3            Shirt\n 4 \u2502 3   Charlie  6 George Street  3            Underwear  The  innerjoin  function can be used to join any tables based on any conditions. However, by default only the  isequal  comparison is accelerated via a temporary hash index - all other comparisons will invoke an exhaustive  O ( n^2 ) algorithm.  See the section on  AcceleratedArrays  for methods of (a) attaching secondary acceleration indices to your columns, and (b) using these to accelerate operations other than  isequal . For example, a  SortIndex  can be used to accelerate joins on order-related predicates, such as the value in one column being smaller than another column.",
